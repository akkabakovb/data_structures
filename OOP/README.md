# Assignment 1 – Basic Classes & Objects
First steps in OOP: design small classes, use constructors, getters / setters, test with a driver.

| File | What it shows |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `Point.java` | 2-D point with coords & setters |
| `Circle.java` | extends Shape, computes area & circumference |
| `Square.java` | extends Shape, computes area & perimeter |
| `Shape.java` | tiny base class to demo inheritance |
| `Person.java` | simple POJO with BMI conversion |
| `TestPoint.java` | driver that instantiates shapes & prints metrics |

Run:  
javac *.java && java TestPoint

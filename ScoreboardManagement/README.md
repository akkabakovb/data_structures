# Assignment 6 – Scoreboard Management
Keep top game scores; compare array vs. linked-list back-ends.

Core (required)
| File | What it shows |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `GameEntry.java` | immutable score object |
| `Scoreboard.java` | array-backed, auto-sorted high-score table |
| `TestScoreboard.java` | fills board with random data, prints stats |

Extra (linked-list versions)
| `ScoreboardSLL.java` | same API backed by your SinglyLinkedList |
| `ScoreboardDLL.java` | same API backed by your DoublyLinkedList |

Run:  
javac *.java && java TestScoreboard
